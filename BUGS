* v4l and v4l2 i/o can ignore timeout parameter
  > maybe a sleep() loop works, but what about timestamping?
* vbi_page.text[1056] < 26 * 41. D'oh! (fixed in 0.3)
* timestamp routines assume timeval.tv_sec and .tv_usec are signed.
* Doxumentation needs compile instructions and more examples.
* test/decode --idl, --pfc broken?
* Make sure test apps flush their output buffers once per frame
  for real time output.
* strerror() isn't thread-safe.
* In src/raw_decoder.c/decode_pattern() and the stupidly named
  vbi3_raw_decoder_decode() if the driver does not provide line
  numbers but we find exactly one CC line per field we should
  make up line numbers to distinguish fields.
* test: decode output differs from sliced2pes | decode output.
  Probably have to flush the PES demux.
* ntsc-cc needs an update to skip raw data in test samples.
