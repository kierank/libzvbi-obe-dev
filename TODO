Version 0.3

* Events suck badly. Change to query functions (fetch page, station
  name, aspect ratio, ...) and just notify apps of changes.
* vbi_page split into public and private, allocate when fetched.
* Finish vbi_fetch_* reference counting.
* Make Teletext column 41 optional.
* decoder.c: Having a public vbi_decoder and vbi_bit_slicer is bad.
  Should be both opaque (except slicer in vbi_decoder),
  with new public vbi_sampling_parameters structure.
* print should translate linefeeds to target charset (wchar...)
* io: Add io-dvb. Generally speaking the i/o api is poor,
  should be improved.
* search.c: Add vbi_wst_level.
* packet.c: Add filter for data pages (EPG etc).
* Add VPT decoder.
* VR triggers from VPS/PDC/XDS.
* Program info from TTX (8/30 and VPS/PDC).
* Can we replace ASCII/Latin-1/local by a single char set? Perhaps UTF-8?
* Suppose Turkish currency sign U+E800 can be replaced by U+20A4,
  Unicode 3.1: "20A4 LIRA SIGN\n* Italy, Turkey"
* Better interface to language codes.
* Improve TTX roll header + serial (Mxx increment).
* Spacing ESC
* Streaming subtitles (as opposed to exporting single pages).
* Not relocatable (bindtextdomain)
* exp-gfx.c: draw_*_page_region different formats, custom fonts.
* TTX export: Make blockgfx replacement smarter.
* Think about ttx header samples (p100) for stations not transmitting
  a CNI (instead of guessing the name from ttx). May use VTX to create
  samples.
* SGML error reporting. (Not sure anymore if this is
  really worth the trouble.)
